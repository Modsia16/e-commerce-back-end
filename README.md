## Project story
A manager at an internet retail company wants a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
so that their company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Criteria

```md
With a functional Express.js API when I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

When I enter schema and seed commands then a development database is created and is seeded with test data

When I enter the command to invoke the application, then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core,  I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

## Project minutes
